Binaries of **Virtual Choir Rehearsal Room**
for Linux, Windows, and MacOS are available below.
All of them are compiled for Intel/AMD cpu.

If you have newer Apple with M1 cpu, use the script `install-mac.sh`
to compile the newest version of the application yourself;
this may take a little longer.

For more information about the application see [its webpage][web].
